*Notes from speaking to consultants about client feedback*

### PRCA (See Provider Tool below)
 * More actionable
 * Simplified
 * More information
 * Change how calculations are done
 * Show raw PMPM
 * Too complicated

### CMD
 * Make more obvious where things are going wrong
 * Not quite member level info
 * Financial standpoint (drill in by facility or QMs)
   * SNF costs
   * ER costs
   * IP costs
 * Use metrics that people can be proactive about
 * Do summary level of metrics
 * Compare year over year
 * Show trends
 * Measure against prior year or benchmarks

### CCR
 * Flag for pregnancies
 * Number of ER visits for CY
 * Number of IP admits for CY
 * Number of Readmits for CY
 * Search by NPI
 * Search by TIN
 * Last service date for office visit (this is currently shown in CCR but not obvious enough)
 * Population Summary not useful
 * Diabetes – more actionable information
 * Overwhelming amount of information

### Provider Tool
 * Provider Level -> assigned patient level -> QMs
 * OR clinical/regional level -> physician level
 * One page reports/scorecards
 1. Shared savings
  * Savings distributions
  * Allocate funding amongst physicians (assigning values)
 2. Help develop/evaluate high performance networks
 3. Facilitate data driven conversations with providers
   * QMs by provider and assigned patient
   * Report card

### End of Life

### A system level tool
 * Scorecard/dashboard
 * Something that makes obvious where issues are
 * Would like to be able to drill into service categories
 * Drill in by facility/physician
 * Some sort of benchmarking
 * Quality Metrics
   * Top 10 providers doing poorly in Quality measures
   * What measures can be managed best
 * Oregon pays out money equally based on number of quality measures passed
 * Should tell the user where they should focus
